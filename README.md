# Multiplication-Table
This entire folder will be Multiplication Tables created in multiple programming Languages. 
This is a project designed to help those learning. 
Therefore the code in this folder will be public domain and can be used to take apart, use in other projects.
Please comment if anyone sees a bug or a way to fine tune the code (including making rem statements) to help those learning.
If this sparks an idea, feel free to branch and take it on or help out.

I will be adding more code and fine tuning as time goes on.

Enjoy...
